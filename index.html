        <h2>About Alia Michaels</h2>
        <p class="description">
          I have worked as a freelance technical writer for more than twenty-five years. During this time, I have developed help systems, training materials and classes, and technical and end-user documentation. I also edit technical documentation and can transcribe recorded material for other purposes.</p>

          <p class="description">Most of my projects have been for companies that produce end-user software products. I have written about software and networking products used with macOS, iOS, Windows, and other operating systems and for cloud-based applications.</p>

          <p class="description">Usually, I work as an independent contractor (1099) and am an experienced remote worker — having worked from my home office for most of my freelance career. I also work as a remote W-2 contractor.</p>
